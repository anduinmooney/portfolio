          <h2>Background:</h2>
          <p>I was born in Portland, OR in 1996, making me 20 years old. Since then, I've been moving back and forth between Portland and Vancouver, originally due to my parents being seperated. I know both areas pretty well, but I of course prefer Portland. I graduated from Heritage High School in 2015 with a year of college already under my belt, and since then, I've worked a variety of jobs, including the USPS as a mail carrier and operating machines in a clean room at SEH America. After leaving SEH, I moved to Portland and got a job at AMFOR electronics, which only lasted a few months. After AMFOR, I decided to continue my education and attempt to finish my associates degree at Portland Community College, which I attended from 2016-2017. During the summer of 2017, I attended a workshop at Epicodus to see if a tradeschool would work better for me, and I loved it. I decided to enroll into Epicodus, and here I am now with only a week of experience in coding.</p>
          <h2>Hobbies & Interests:</h2>
          <p>As far as hobbies go, I spend my free time playing video games such as Counter Strike, or hang out with friends. I love computers, and after building my own in 2013ish, I'm pretty sure I haven't missed a day of being on it, either playing games or just watching shows or listening to music. </p>
