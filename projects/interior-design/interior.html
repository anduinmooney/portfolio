  peruse around, and lets get lost together in all things design!</p>

  <p>This home is finally completed!! We’ve been working on this house for the past 2 years and it’s the best feeling that
  we have happy clients in the end. When we started, this house was a little bungalow. The clients had
  plans to smash it down to the ground and start from scratch. They wanted a modern farmhouse vibe, and so the
  exterior of the house was basically set in stone, but the clients allowed us to come through and tweak it a
  bit, to make it feel a little less beachy, and a little more modern. It was an excellent effort from the
  whole crew of  GDC Construction and a pleasure getting to work with them to help our clients get exactly what
  they wanted.</p>

  <p>Being this clients second designer meant we had to really listen to the clients needs and deliver
  everything they wanted and more. In the end we gave them the refined and chic beach home of their dreams.</p>
